# Streams playlist

This playlist is in [XSPF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Shareable_Playlist_Format).  I play it with [Audacious](https://audacious-media-player.org/).  XSPF is also supported by VLC and (I think?) Foobar2K.

To identify streams, add the "Comment" column in your player.  "Title" and "Artist" are often updated dynamically.

For now, all streams are in one playlist file.  I added a repo (not a gist) because I might split up the file someday.

Broadcast streams are listed first.  Many of the broadcast streams in this playlist are based in the midwest USA.
